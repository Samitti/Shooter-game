## Game Design
The main objective of this project was to build a platform game. I got inspiration from Zenva Academy Tutorial to implement the game design, different scenes, and scoring system. I collected some of the game assets from free license resources and customized them using photoshop, and some of the sound effects from Zenva Academy Tutorial.
- The Game logic is that a player shoots at flying dragons and destroy as many as possible before they fire the player or collide with the player.
- the scoring system is designed on the type of dragon. In this case, the player gets a higher score whenever destroying the fighter dragons.

- There are three types of enemy dragons

- The red dragons, which are very dangerous and give you a higher score if you destroy them

- The green and the purple ones are less dangerous than the red ones and give you less score than the red ones if you destroy them. 

- There is one fully armed fighter jet for the player that can destroy any dragon.
