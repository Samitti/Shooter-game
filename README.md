- There are three types of enemy dragons

- The red dragons, which are very dangerous and give you higher score if you destroy them

- The green and the puple ones which are less dangerous than the red ones and give you less score than the red ones if you destroy them. 

- There is one fully armed fighter jet for the player that can destroy any dragon.
